1-Apr-20	Adding Events to site	1 Hour	! Hour																						
8-Apr-20	git upstream tracking			The currrent branch has no upstream branch	"So you create a git branch, switch to it (using the checkout command), then make your changes, and finally merge the changes into master and delete your branch
Ok, what that command is doing is pushing your CORP_KG-11 local branch to that upstream/remote repository.
That's usually if you have a large project with multiple people working on it, and you want everyone to have access to the same branch

By default you don't want branches you create locally to go to GitHub (or your remote) because they're just small temporary branches
but sometimes you do
So for example there's different versions there (flutter-1.17-candidate.0-5). After enough testing they'll make a release, which is just a freeze of everything in the repository
You can do that using the tag command
If you type git log it shows you every commit. Some commits are special though, so you can add a tag to them, and then refer back to them
For this project you can just commit to the master branch (equivalent to trunk in SVN/Subversion), unless you guys want me to also teach you how to work with branches, forks, and pull requests
So long story short, if you tell git to track an upstream branch, then when you do a git pull or git fetch it'll download that code too
Otherwise you might not need or want the other branches"

Gives 100 dummy data records by default and gives various options for populating the model / table in various ways.

Django already adds the name of the model along with name of the model, for example if we have created a model called attendee then the table name in the database will be event_attendee"
